# Decentralized_Verification

Identity Verification Smart Contract
Overview
This project implements an Identity Verification Smart Contract to register users, issue credentials, and verify credentials on the blockchain. This smart contract is designed to be integrated into decentralized applications (dApps) for secure and tamper-proof identity verification.

Features
User Registration: Register users with their public keys.
Credential Issuance: Issue credentials to registered users.
Credential Verification: Verify the authenticity of issued credentials.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
npm or yarn
Solidity (v0.8.0 or later)
Truffle or Hardhat
MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/identity-verification-smart-contract.git
cd identity-verification-smart-contract
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Compile the smart contract:

bash
Copy code
truffle compile
or

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the smart contract to a local blockchain (e.g., Ganache):

bash
Copy code
truffle migrate
or

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Usage
Register a New User:

rust
Copy code
// Register a new user with their public key
public fun register_user(public_key: Bytes): U64 {
    let id = global::counter::new();
    global::storage::save<User>(id, User { id, public_key });
    id
}
Call the register_user function with the user's public key.
The function returns a unique user ID.
Issue a Credential:

rust
Copy code
// Issue a credential to a user
public fun issue_credential(subject: Address, data: Bytes): U64 {
    let id = global::counter::new();
    global::storage::save<Credential>(id, Credential { id, global::transaction::sender(), subject, data });
    id
}
Call the issue_credential function with the subject's address and credential data.
The function returns a unique credential ID.
Verify a Credential:

rust
Copy code
// Verify a user's credential
public fun verify_credential(credential_id: U64): bool {
    let credential = global::storage::load<Credential>(credential_id);
    if (credential.is_some()) {
        // Add your verification logic here
        // For example, you could check if the issuer is a trusted entity
        // or verify the data in the credential
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
Call the verify_credential function with the credential ID.
The function returns true if the credential is verified, otherwise false.
Smart Contract Structures
rust
Copy code
struct User {
    id: U64,
    public_key: Bytes,
}

struct Credential {
    id: U64,
    issuer: Address,
    subject: Address,
    data: Bytes,
}
